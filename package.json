Why create this project that is very similar to NiceGui?\r - The first reason was that NiceGui requires websockets to work and when experimenting with the framework it caused some issues on my hosting platform.\r - Learning. I wanted to figure out how to do something simillar but without using websockets\r   - I wanted to try out HTMX\r - Limited control over the underlaying tech stack but mainly just learning",
